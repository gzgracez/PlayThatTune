Play That Tune
============
* MusicTestNew.java generates random music (including pitch, duration, baseNote of an accompanying chord, etc.) and writes it to a text file.
* NameThatTune1.java reads the music from the text file and plays the music, adding random trills and also outputting a visual display to go with the music - a tiger uses its baton to conduct a musical note whose position (mapped to a polar coordinate system) and color are based on the pitch and duration of the note.
* Actual sheet music also appears as the notes are played - as one note plays, the same note appears on the staff lines (works with the notes on the chromatic scale), including the trill symbol.
* The randomly generated song (including the randomly generated trills) is then saved to a .wav file for future enjoyment!
